Inserted a few-line guard in sympy/geometry/point.py (Point.__add__) to detect expressions of the form scalar*Point and convert them into a Point (by extracting the Point factor and multiplying it by the scalar) before the existing normalization logic. This prevents a TypeError/GeometryError when adding expressions like sympify(2.0)*Point2D(...) and makes both orders (Point*scalar and scalar*Point) behave the same.
