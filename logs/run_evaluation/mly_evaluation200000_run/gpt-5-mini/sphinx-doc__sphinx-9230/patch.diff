Made a small fix in sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py to support ":param <type> <name>:" where the type contains parentheses (e.g. "dict(str, str) opc_meta"). This ensures the type and name are parsed correctly when the original regex doesn't match. Ran the relevant napoleon docstring test to validate.
