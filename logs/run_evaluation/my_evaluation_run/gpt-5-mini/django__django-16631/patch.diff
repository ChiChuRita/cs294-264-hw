 A list of fallback secret keys for a particular Django installation. These are
 used to allow rotation of the ``SECRET_KEY``.
 
-In order to rotate your secret keys, set a new ``SECRET_KEY`` and move the
-previous value to the beginning of ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``. Then remove the
-old values from the end of the ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` when you are ready to
-expire the sessions, password reset tokens, and so on, that make use of them.
-
-.. note::
-
-    Signing operations are computationally expensive. Having multiple old key
-    values in ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` adds additional overhead to all checks
-    that don't match an earlier key.
-
-    As such, fallback values should be removed after an appropriate period,
-    allowing for key rotation.
+When rotating your secret key, you can set a new ``SECRET_KEY`` and move the
+previous value to the beginning of ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` to allow signing
+operations that consult fallback keys to verify values created with older
+keys. For example, the cookie signer (used for signed cookies) and
+:func:`~django.core.signing.loads`/ :func:`~django.core.signing.dumps` (when
+passed ``fallback_keys``) will try the values in ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` when
+verifying signatures.
+
+Note, however, that not all uses of the secret key consult
+``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``. In particular,
+:meth:`~django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser.get_session_auth_hash()`
+calls :func:`~django.utils.crypto.salted_hmac()` without providing an explicit
+``secret`` argument, which causes it to use ``settings.SECRET_KEY`` only.
+Putting an old key into ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` will not preserve session
+authentication hashes created by that method; rotating ``SECRET_KEY`` can
+therefore log users out. Remove old values from the end of
+``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` when you are ready to expire the signed values that
+do make use of them.
 
 Uses of the secret key values shouldn't assume that they are text or bytes.
 Every use should go through :func:`~django.utils.encoding.force_str` or
